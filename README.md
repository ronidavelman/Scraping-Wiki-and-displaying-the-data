# Scraping-Wiki-and-displaying-the-data
Process: Created a java scrapper to get the info, exported to json, and showed the information dynamically with json. 

I used a java scrapping library called JSOUP to get the data, then JSON-Simple to export it as valid JSON. I then used some simple Javascript to load up the information in a webpage.
